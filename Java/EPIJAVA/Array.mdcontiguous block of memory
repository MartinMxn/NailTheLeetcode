contiguous block of memory

# Trick in Array:
Use the array itself to reduce space complexity to 0(1). [Problem 6.1]
write values from the back. [Problem 6.2]
Instead of deleting an entry consider overwriting it. [Problem 6.5]
Be comfortable with writing code that operates on subarrays. [Problem 6.10]
#### 
Don't forget the length of an array is given by the length field,  
unlike Collections, which uses the size() method, and String, which use the length() method.
#### 
Remember APIs: asListO(moreonthislater),binarySearch(A, 641),copyOf(A),  
copyOfRange(A, 1,5), equals(A, B), fill(A, 42), find(A, 28), sort(A), sort(A,cmp), toStringO.
